🐔 The Egg Randomizer – True Randomness from Nature 🥚

The Egg Randomizer is an experimental project that generates truly random numbers using the unpredictable egg-laying patterns of Eastern Egger chickens. Unlike traditional computer-generated pseudo-random numbers, this approach leverages real-world natural entropy from my 9 chickens, which lay eggs in random colors and quantities each day.

How It Works:
Each egg’s color is mapped to a unique prime number.
Each hen’s egg count (0, 1, or 2) acts as a multiplier.
A position weight is assigned to each hen to enhance entropy.
The collected data is processed using a mathematical formula to generate a random number.
A modular function and cryptographic hashing improve randomness and prevent predictable cycles.
Potential Applications:
🔒 Cryptographic Key Generation
🎲 Gaming Randomization
📊 Statistical Simulations
🔬 Scientific Experimentation

This project is inspired by real-world randomness techniques, like Cloudflare’s lava lamp entropy source, and aims to explore the fusion of biology and mathematics to create a verifiable, natural source of randomness.

🌱 Future Plans:

📝 Data Collection: Logging daily egg variations for statistical analysis.
🧮 Algorithm Refinement: Improving randomness calculations.
🔗 API Development: Making the randomizer accessible for broader applications.
Repo Contents:
📂 /data/ - Collected daily egg-laying data.
